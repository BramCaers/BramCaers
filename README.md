- 👋 Hi, I’m @BramCaers
- 👀 I’m interested in DH approaches to literary texts of the Middle Ages and Early Modern Times. I am working with HTR methods and am looking for ways to enrich text files for DH methods.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on HTR for Dutch material and theorizing the output of automated models.
- 📫 How to reach me: look me up on the Leiden University website or follow me on Twitter
